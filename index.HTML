        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am an artist still learning how to convert everything around me into storytelling. I use different materials and make art in various forms. My favorite form is painting, but I have recently gained an interest in ceramics and clay art.</p>

        <h2>ART THERAPY</h2>
        <p>I like connecting with people through my art, helping them use art as a language to communicate things they might not express otherwise. I have conducted several sessions already, and I enjoy helping people through art.</p>
